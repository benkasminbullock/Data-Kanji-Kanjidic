=head1 NAME

Data::Kanji::Kanjidic - parse the "kanjidic" kanji data file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

[% example("example") %]

=head1 VERSION

This documents [% info.colon %] version [% info.version %]
corresponding to git commit L<[% commit.commit %]|[% info.repo
%]/commit/[% commit.commit %]> released on [% commit.date %].

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This extracts the data from the old-format F<kanjidic> kanji
dictionary file. See L</About Kanjidic> if you are not familiar with
this data file.

This module's basic function is to read the F<kanjidic> file into
memory and create a data structure from it. Parsing Kanjidic takes a
second or two. Here the Kanjidic file is the as-downloaded text file
in the old format, rather than the new-format XML file.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 grade

    my $grade2 = grade ($kanjidic_ref, 2);

Given a school grade such as C<2> above, and the return value of
L</parse_kanjidic>, C<$kanjidic_ref>, return an array reference
containing a list of all of the kanji from that grade. [%
faqwhat("education", "How is Japanese writing taught to Japanese
children?", "details of the Japanese education system") %]

The following example prints a list of the kanji from each school
grade to standard output:

[% example("grades") %]

=head2 grade_stroke_order

This is like L</kanji_dictionary_order> and
L</stroke_radical_jis_order>, except it sorts the kanji by school
grade, then by stroke number, then by JIS number.

This function is used to make this [% faq("grade-list","List of kanji
by elementary school grade") %].

=head2 kanji_dictionary_order

    my @sorted = sort {kanji_dictionary_order ($kanjidic_ref, $a, $b)} @kanji;

This is a comparision function which puts kanji in the order they
would be found in a Japanese kanji dictionary. Elements are sorted by
the value of the L</radical> field, then by the first stroke count
value (the first entry of the L</S> field) if they both have the same
radical. Elements with the same stroke count and radical are finally
sorted in order of their JIS code value.

This also adds a new field "kanji_id" to each element of
C<$kanjidic_ref> so that the order can be reconstructed when referring
to elements.

[% faqwhat("using-a-kanji-dictionary", "How is a kanji dictionary
used?", "kanji dictionary ordering") %] [% faqwhat("radicals", "What
are kanji radicals?", "kanji radicals") %]

=head2 kanjidic_order

    my @order = kanjidic_order ($k);

This returns a list of the keys of C<$k> sorted by their JIS code
number, which is the ordering used by the Kanjidic file itself.

=head2 parse_entry

    my %values = parse_entry ($line);

Parse one line of Kanjidic. The input is one line from Kanjidic,
encoded as Unicode. The return value is a hash containing each field
from the line.

The possible keys and values of the returned hash are as
follows. Values are scalars unless otherwise mentioned.

=over

=item kanji

The kanji itself (the same as the key).

=item jiscode

The JIS code for the kanji in hexadecimal. This is a two-byte number
which identifies the kanji in the L<JIS X 0208 encoding
scheme|https://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/encodings.html#encodings-JIS-X-0208>. The
JIS value is the second value in Kanjidic after the kanji in encoded
form and before the Unicode code point.

[% FOR key IN codes.keys.sort %]

=item [% key %]

[% codes.$key -%].
[%- IF has_dupes.$key %]
This may take multiple values, so the value is an array reference.
[%- END # has dupes -%]

[%- IF key == 'W' %] 

The following example program prints a list of Korean pronunciations,
romanised. This example also requires L<Lingua::KO::Munja>.

[% example("korean") %]
[%- ELSIF key == 'F' %]

The following example program prints a list of kanji from most to least
frequently used.

[% example("frequency") %]
[%- ELSIF key == 'G' %]

This field is also used by kanjidic to give information on whether the
kanji is part of the Joyo or Jinmeiyo Kanji sets. If the grade is
between 1 and 8, the kanji is part of [% faq("jouyou-kanji", "the Joyo
Kanji") %]. If the grade is 9 or 10, then the kanji is not part of the
Joyo kanji, but it is part of the [% faq("jinmeiyou-kanji", "Jinmeiyo
Kanji") %].

See also L</grade>.

[%- END -%]

[%- END # for key %]

=item radical

This is the Kangxi radical of the kanji. This overrides Kanjidic's
preference for the Nelson radical. In other words, this is the same as
the L</B> field for most kanji, but if a L</C> field exists, this is
the value of the C field rather than the B field.

=item kokuji

This has a true value (1) if the character is marked as a "kokuji" in
Kanjidic. [% faqwhat("kokuji", "Which kanji were created in Japan?",
"kokuji") %]

=item english

This contains an array reference to the English-language meanings
given in Kanjidic. It may be undefined, if there are no
English-language meanings listed.

[% example("english-to-kanji") %]

Given input like this,

[% INCLUDE "example.txt" | xtidy %]

it outputs this:

[% INCLUDE "example-out.txt" | xtidy %]

=item onyomi

This is an array reference which contains the [%
faq("kanji-pronunciation", "on'yomi") %] of the kanji. It may be
undefined, if no I<on'yomi> readings are listed. The I<on'yomi>
readings are in katakana, as per Kanjidic itself. It is encoded in
Perl's internal Unicode encoding.

The following example prints a list of kanji which have the same on'yomi:

[% example("onyomi-same") %]

=item kunyomi

This is an array reference which contains the [%
faq("kanji-pronunciation", "kun'yomi") %].  It may be undefined, if no
I<kun'yomi> readings are listed. The I<kun'yomi> readings are in
hiragana, as per Kanjidic itself. It is encoded in Perl's internal
Unicode encoding.

=item nanori

This is an array reference which contains I<nanori> (名乗り) readings
of the character, which are readings of the kanji used in names. It
may be undefined, if no I<nanori> readings are listed. The I<nanori>
readings are in hiragana, as per Kanjidic itself. They are encoded in
Perl's internal Unicode encoding.

=item morohashi

This is a hash reference containing data on the kanji's location in
the Morohashi 'Dai Kan-Wa Jiten' kanji dictionary. The hash reference
has the following keys.

=over

=item volume

The volume number of the character.

=item page

The page number of the character.

=item index

The index number of the character.

=back

If there is no information, this remains unset.

For example, to print all the existing values,

[% example("morohashi") %]

=back

For detailed explanations of these codes, see the kanjidic
documentation, which is linked to under L</About Kanjidic>.

=head2 parse_kanjidic

[% example("parse-kanjidic") %]

The input is the file name where Kanjidic may be found. The return
value is a hash reference. The keys of this hash reference are kanji,
encoded as Unicode. Each of the values of the hash reference are
entries corresponding to the kanji in the keys. Each value represents
one line of Kanjidic. Each is a hash reference, with the keys
described in L</parse_entry>.

This function assumes that the kanjidic file is encoded using the
EUC-JP encoding.

=head2 stroke_radical_jis_order

    @list = sort { stroke_radical_jis_order ($kanjidic, $a, $b) } @list;

This is a comparison function which sorts kanji C<$a> and C<$b>
according to stroke count, the L</S> field. If the stroke count is
identical, it sorts them according to L</radical>. If both the stroke
count and radical are the same, it sorts them according to
L</jiscode>.

=head2 About Kanjidic

Kanjidic is a product of the L<Electronic Dictionary Research and
Development Group (EDRDG)|http://www.edrdg.org/>, headed by Professor
J.W. Breen, formerly of Monash University, Australia.

Kanjidic is currently supplied in two formats, a text format with the
kanji encoded in the EUC-JP encoding, and an XML format with the same
kanji data encoded in Unicode. This module parses the older text
format of kanjidic.
