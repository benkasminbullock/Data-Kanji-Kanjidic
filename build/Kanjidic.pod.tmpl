=head1 NAME

Data::Kanji::Kanjidic - parse the "kanjidic" kanji data file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

[% INCLUDE "example.pl" | xtidy %]

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 parse_kanjidic

    my $kanjidic = parse_kanjidic ('kanjidic');

The input is the file name where Kanjidic may be found. The return
value is a hash reference. The keys of this hash reference are kanji,
encoded as Unicode. Each of the values of the hash reference are
entries corresponding to the kanji in the keys. Each value represents
one line of Kanjidic. Each is a hash reference, with the keys
described in L</parse_entry>.

This function assumes that the kanjidic file is encoded using the
EUC-JP encoding.

=head2 parse_entry

    my %values = parse_entry ($line);

Parse one line of Kanjidic. The input is one line from Kanjidic,
encoded as Unicode. The return value is a hash containing each field
from the line.

The possible keys and values of the returned hash are as
follows. Values are scalars unless otherwise mentioned.

=over

=item kanji

The kanji itself (the same as the key).

[% FOR key IN codes.keys.sort %]

=item [% key %]

[% codes.$key -%].
[%- IF has_dupes.$key %]
This may take multiple values, so the value is an array reference.
[%- END # has dupes -%]

[%- IF key == 'W' %] 

The following example program prints a list of Korean pronunciations,
romanized (requires L<Lingua::KO::Munja>).

[% INCLUDE "korean.pl" | xtidy %]
[%- ELSIF key == 'F' %]

The following example program prints a list of kanji from most to least
frequently used.

[% INCLUDE "frequency.pl" | xtidy %]
[%- END -%]

[%- END # for key %]

=item kokuji

This has a true value (1) if the character is marked as a "kokuji" in
Kanjidic. See L<http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/kokuji.html>.

=item english

This contains an array reference to the English-language meanings
given in Kanjidic. It may be undefined, if there are no
English-language meanings listed.

[% INCLUDE "english-to-kanji.pl" | xtidy %]

Given input like this,

[% INCLUDE "example.txt" | xtidy %]

it outputs this:

[% INCLUDE "example-out.txt" | xtidy %]

=item onyomi

This is an array reference which contains the I<on'yomi> (音読) of the
kanji. (See L<http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/kanji-pronunciation.html>.)
It may be undefined, if no I<on'yomi> readings are listed. The
I<on'yomi> readings are in katakana, as per Kanjidic itself. It is
encoded in Perl's internal Unicode encoding.

The following example prints a list of kanji which have the same on'yomi:

[% INCLUDE "onyomi-same.pl" | xtidy %]

=item kunyomi

This is an array reference which contains the I<kun'yomi> (訓読) of
the kanji. (See
L<http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/kanji-pronunciation.html>.) It may be
undefined, if no I<kun'yomi> readings are listed. The I<kun'yomi>
readings are in hiragana, as per Kanjidic itself. It is encoded in
Perl's internal Unicode encoding.

=item nanori

This is an array reference which contains I<nanori> (名乗り) readings
of the character. It may be undefined, if no I<nanori> readings are
listed. The I<nanori> readings are in hiragana, as per Kanjidic
itself. They are encoded in Perl's internal Unicode encoding.

=item morohashi

This is a hash reference containing data on the kanji's location in
the Morohashi 'Dai Kan-Wa Jiten' kanji dictionary. The hash reference
has the following keys.

=over

=item volume

The volume number of the character.

=item page

The page number of the character.

=item index

The index number of the character.

=back

If there is no information, this remains unset.

For example, to print all the existing values,

[% INCLUDE "morohashi.pl" | xtidy %]

=back

For detailed explanations of these codes, see L</Kanjidic>.

=head2 kanjidic_order

    kanjidic_order ($kanjidic_ref);

Return a list sorted by stroke order of the elements of
C<\%kanjidic>. Also add the field "kanji_id" to each of them so that
the order can be reconstructed when referring to elements.

=head2 grade

    my $grade2 = grade ($kanjidic_ref, 2);

Given a school grade such as C<2> above, and the return value of
L</parse_kanjidic>, C<$kanjidic_ref>, return an array reference
containing a list of all of the kanji from that grade.
