=head1 SYNOPSIS

[% INCLUDE "example.pl" | indent ('    ') %]

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 parse_kanjidic

    my $kanjidic = parse_kanjidic ('kanjidic');

The input is the name of the file. The output is a hash reference. The
keys of the hash reference are kanji, encoded as Unicode. The values
of the hash reference are entries corresponding to the kanji in the
keys. Each value represents one line of Kanjidic. Each is a hash
reference, with the keys described in L</parse_entry>.

This function assumes that the kanjidic file is encoded using the
EUC-JP encoding.

=head2 parse_entry

    my %values = parse_entry ($line);

Parse one line of F<kanjidic>.

The possible keys and values of the returned hash are as
follows. Values are scalars unless otherwise mentioned.
